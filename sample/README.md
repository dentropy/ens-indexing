# Index of all ENS names with resolved Text Records

## General Info:

This sample dataset contains a list of 1000 ENS text records set as well as what all those text records resolve to.

The data is taken from TheGraph and then queries raw from Ethereum itself.

## The Dataset:

The data is primarily stored in a sqlite database which is available in the full dataset where there are two tables, ens_name, and ens_records_resolved. From there two CSV and JSON files for each table respectably are generated from said tables.
